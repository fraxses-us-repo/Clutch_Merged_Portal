        <p>I agree to receive the services provided by Clutch Diagnostics, Dr. Roberts S. Kaufmann, MD (RSKMD), and certain
        other affiliated professional entities (collectively, "Clutch", "we" or "us") relating to physician oversight of laboratory
        tests ("Tests"), including, without limitation, evaluation of the test request, ordering of Tests (if appropriate), receipt
        of Test results ("Results"), consultations via telemedicine with physicians or healthcare providers ("Consults"),
        customer support or counseling and any other related services provided by Clutch or its service providers. All clinical
        services, including services provided by physicians, will be provided through RSKMD or their contractually affiliated
        professional entities.</p>

        <p>I acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am the individual who will provide the sample for the Test(s) that I am requesting.</li>
            <li>I am at least eighteen (18) years of age.</li>
            <li>I have read and understand the information provided about the Test(s) that I have been provided on the Clutch Diagnostics website. For COVID-19 testing, additional information is also available at the CDC website <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a>.
            <li>In order to utilize the Self-Collection Lab Kits by Clutch Diagnostics, I must provide an appropriate sample for the Test(s), which may include a nasal swab, hair, saliva, or other samples.
            <li>The information I have provided in connection with the Self-Collection Lab Kits by Clutch Diagnostics is correct to the best of my knowledge. I will not hold Clutch, Dr. Robert S. Kaufmann MD, or its health care providers responsible for any errors or omissions that I may have made in providing such information.
            <li>The Clutch lab testing services do not constitute treatment of any condition, disease, or illness.</li>
            <li>While Clutch and the laboratories implement safeguards to avoid errors, as with all laboratory tests, there is a chance of a false positive or false-negative result.</li>
            <li>I am responsible for checking for results notification and logging on to my online account with the instructions that are provided to me after registering a Self-Collection Lab Kit by Clutch Diagnostics, to view my results when available.</li>
            <li>If I receive an abnormal Test Result, I understand that a Clutch care coordinator may attempt to call me to review the results, offer education and explain the next steps I should take. The Clutch care coordinator may leave me a voicemail but will not include my test results in any voicemail message. If I receive an abnormal result and have not connected with a Clutch care coordinator, I understand that I should not delay following up with my personal physician. If I have received a positive Test Result on a COVID-19 PCR Test, I will receive a call from a Clutch care coordinator as described above; however, if I receive a positive result on a COVID-19 antibody Test, I will not receive a call.</li>
            <li>I certify that throughout the duration of the Clutch Services I receive, including my Consult, I will be physically present in the state of residence I provided or other states of which I have notified Clutch.</li>
            <li>I am responsible for forwarding any results to my primary care or other personal physician and for initiating follow-up with such physician for care, diagnosis, or medical treatment.</li>
            <li>I will not make medical decisions without consulting a healthcare provider or disregard medical advice from my healthcare provider or delay seeking such advice based on information as a result of the use of Clutch Services.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>If I receive an abnormal result on a COVID-19 Test (PCR and antibody Tests), my name, Test Result, and other required information may be disclosed to federal or state health agencies in accordance with applicable law. I understand that Clutch Diagnostics and Dr. Robert S. Kaufmann MD services are delivered by health care providers who are not in the same physical location as I am using electronic communications, information technology, or other means, including the electronic transmission of personal health information. I also understand that:</p>
        <ul>
              <li>I may need to see a health care provider in-person for diagnosis, treatment and care.</li>
              <li>There are potential risks associated with the use of technology, including disruptions, loss of data and technical difficulties.</li>
              <li>There are alternative services, such as visiting a primary care provider, an emergency room, or an urgent care facility.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I understand that if I have any questions before or after my Test, I can contact Clutch at the email address or phone
        number below and I will be connected or directed to a member of the Clutch Care Coordination including a physician,
        if requested or as otherwise applicable.</p>

        <p>I authorize Clutch to use the email address and phone number I provided at the time I requested the Test on the
        Clutch Diagnostics website (or that I updated by contacting Clutch at the email below) to contact me in connection
        with the Clutch Services. I am responsible for contacting Clutch at the email address below to notify them of any
        changes to my mailing address, email address, phone number, or other information that I provided in connection with
        Clutch Services.</p>

        <p>I understand that testing is voluntary and that I may withdraw my consent to testing at any time prior to the
        completion of the Test(s) by contacting Clutchâ€™s Care Coordination Team at <a>patientservices@clutch.health</a>.</p>
